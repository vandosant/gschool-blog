I'm listening to [The Frontside Podcast](https://frontsidethepodcast.simplecast.fm) episode [Myth of the Lone Genius Programmer](https://frontsidethepodcast.simplecast.fm/6). In it Brandon Hayes, who spoke to us during the
first week of gSchool, questions the idea of one individual achieving greatness alone, and how it is toxic.

This concept really connects with me and my past attempts to learn to program.

I began my first semester of college at the University of Georgia as a
computer science major. After spending most of my high school days in front of my computer at home, learning to program seemed like the natural next step.

My time had been spent playing online games (Quake and Starcraft, mostly). I also hosted and attended LAN
 parties with my friends. For me, gaming was a very social activity.
 
Two major emotions I can remember feeling about learning to program were frustration and isolation. 
Everyone seemed very competitive with each other. The teachers and TA's were not very accommodating. This was not like gaming. This was not very fun at all. 

Granted, I was in a huge intro to programming class filled with about 150 students. But still, for someone with as
strong an interest in computers, there was no lack of drive for me to become a programmer. What got me was how daunting the transition appeared, and having nobody to ask for help or share my frustrations with. 

Now, 2/3rds of the way through gSchool. I am a web developer. This stuff makes sense. It feels natural already.
 There is nothing wrong with me, I just got scared away too soon.
 
The reason I made it here is because I have been around an amazing group of teachers and fellow students that have encouraged and
motivated me. More importantly, the teachers have been very helpful and I have shared a powerful growth and transformation (through frustration) with my fellow students.

Developers are simply better when they work together. Having a commonly 
shared experience with others is what feeds my excitement as a programmer. Collaborating also, as Brandon points out,
 helps point out my strengths and weaknesses, thus making my efforts to improve my abilities more effective.

Working together as programmers is an essential activity. Our exposure to others and the resultant feedback
 allows us to continue improving. So whether it's through being mentored, mentoring others, working on group projects, or
 just talking to others who do what you do, you gain important insights to your own exciting journey as a programmer --
 especially that there are many others to share your journey with!
