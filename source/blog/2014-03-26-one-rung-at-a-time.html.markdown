The lego analogy comes up a lot in our gSchool lectures and other programming conversations.
It's the idea that an individual lego does not have much meaning, but as you combine them together
they form something larger and more important than themselves.

For me, the analogy holds up. I started programming on a very small scale with simple calculations in Python.
Slowly, over the past 6 months, I have added more complexity. The core of what I am doing is still the same (programming!),
but I've added more parts. As a new component is added, I am able to focus my energy on understanding that piece and allow it to sink in and
 become second nature. Once I regain my footing, I am ready to add another layer of complexity on top and begin
 mixing it in. This methodical buildup has worked very well for me.

Having taught myself the guitar, I am used to learning this way. However, this is not the only option.

I was talking to a friend of mine that has been teaching himself Javascript. Instead of a gradual buildup of complexity, he started at a very high and complex level and has been
 slowly tearing things down. Recently, while watching a lecture, he had a breakthrough. It was a University lecture by a Stanford professor explaining how a compiler traces through a stack.

My friend pointed out how we are approaching the task of learning to program from opposite ends. I'm starting
 with the basic legos and putting them together, and he is starting with giant boxes and opening them up one at a time. What's cool is whether you start combining individual legos like me or
 tearing down a giant mass of them like my friend (the death star?), it doesn't matter, you are gaining a better understanding of how all of the different pieces work together. We'll eventually
 cross paths. It will be really exciting to fill in the gaps for each other as we race toward the opposite ends of the same goal!
