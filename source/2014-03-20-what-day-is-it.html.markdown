Back to school, back to school.

The beginning of gSchool has been the most grueling learning experience I've had.
I sit in front of a computer all day using all of my energy doing important stuff, like
figuring out if some given year is a leap year, converting integers to roman numerals,
counting beer bottles and grains on a chessboard, and keeping deaf grandma yelling as expected.
It is beautiful.

I'm enrolled in a 6-month web development program that teaches computer programming. We're being taught
Ruby on Rails by Mike Gehard and Jeff Dean from Pivotal Labs.

Twenty-five of us are in class for forty hours each week learning everything we can about websites and web applications.
So far we've done git workflows, TDD, deploying to heroku, the command line, pair programming and http. There's more, but
 you get the idea.

Stay tuned for much more as I strive for programming excellence!
